# Contacts-

This is a mod that adds the option for you to be in Contacts- Sessions in Neos!  
That's right! Only people who **aren't** friends of someone in the session can join! - Isn't that fancy?  

# Installation

To use this mod, you will need the [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) and a settings mod of your choice, such as [NeosModSettings](https://github.com/badhaloninja/NeosModSettings/releases/latest/download/NeosModSettings.dll).  
The modloader is needed to run the mod, while the settings mod is necessary to toggle the contacts-minusness of your sessions on and off.
